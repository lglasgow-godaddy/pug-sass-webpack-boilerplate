# Sass Pug Webpack Boilerplate

This is a super simple "modern" Sass Pug Webpack Boilerplate that anyone can use when they don't wan to use other more complicated codebase's.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Installing [FNM]https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is recommended to manage Node versions if needed. You can find more information about FNM the link above.

```
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
```

## Installing and running

Once its downloaded from Github, to install the boilerplate open a terminal and run this command:

```
npm i
```

In order to run the boilerplate you will need 2 different terminal windows or tabs. In separate terminal tabs or windows run these commands:

```
npm run serve
```
This will run the dev server which can be seen at (http://localhost:9001)

```
npm run watch
```
This runs in the background to auto build the app and to auto-reload the page when there is a change.
